ql-data-analytics-project
A comprehensive collection of SQL scripts for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. These scripts cover various analyses such as database exploration, measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics, segmentation, and more. This repository contains SQL queries designed to help data analysts and BI professionals quickly explore, segment, and analyze data within a relational database. Each script focuses on a specific analytical theme and demonstrates best practices for SQL queries.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
6 Steps:
1. Database Exploration: Understand the data structure, tables, and relationships.
2. Dimension Exploration: Analyze categorical variables, such as demographics or product categories.
3. Date Exploration: Examine date-related variables, including trends and seasonality.
4. Measures Exploration: Investigate numerical variables, such as sales or revenue.
5. Magnitude Analysis: Analyze the scale and distribution of variables.
6. Ranking: Identify top-performing or bottom-performing categories, products, or customers.

Advanced Data Analytics
6 Steps:
1. Changeover Time: Analyze changes in trends or patterns over time.
2. Cumulative Analysis: Examine cumulative values, such as running totals or averages.
3. Performance Analysis: Evaluate performance metrics, such as KPIs or benchmarks.
4. Part to Whole: Analyze the relationship between components and the overall whole.
5. Data Segmentation: Divide data into subsets to identify patterns or trends.
6. Reporting: Create visualizations and reports to communicate insights and findings.

Project Goals
1. Identify trends and patterns: Use EDA to understand the data and identify areas for further analysis.
2. Develop insights: Apply Advanced Data Analytics techniques to gain deeper insights into the data.
3. Communicate findings: Create reports and visualizations to effectively communicate results to stakeholders.

Tools and Techniques
1. Data visualization: Use tools like Tableau, Power BI, or D3.js to create interactive and informative visualizations.
2. Statistical analysis: Apply statistical techniques, such as regression or time series analysis, to identify trends and patterns.
3. Data mining: Use data mining techniques, such as clustering or decision trees, to identify relationships and patterns in the data.
